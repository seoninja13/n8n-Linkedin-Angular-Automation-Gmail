# Critical Backup - Resume Generation Workshop

**Backup Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Backup Time**: 23:00:00 UTC  
**Backup Type**: Pre-Fix Safety Backup

---

## Backup Purpose

This is a **CRITICAL SAFETY BACKUP** created before applying a fix to the Resume Generation Workshop. The workflow is currently functional but producing generic resume content instead of personalized content.

---

## Issue Being Fixed

**Problem**: The AI Resume Customization node is generating generic, fictional resume content instead of customizing the user's actual resume for specific job postings.

**Root Cause**: The AI prompt references `{{ $json.data }}` to access the base resume from the Google Docs node, but the Google Docs node outputs the resume content in `$json.content`, NOT `$json.data`. This causes the AI to receive NO base resume content, so it generates completely generic resumes based only on the job description.

**Planned Fix**: Update the AI Resume Customization node prompt to correctly reference the Google Docs content field:
- **Current (INCORRECT)**: `Base Resume: {{ $json.data }}`
- **Fixed (CORRECT)**: `Base Resume: {{ $('Get a document').item.json.content }}`

## Backup Files

1. **`2025-10-26_Resume-Generation-Workshop_zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG_PRE-FIX.json`**
   - Complete workflow configuration including all nodes, connections, and settings
   - Can be imported directly into N8N or used with N8N MCP tools for restoration

---

## Rollback Procedure

If the fix causes issues, you can restore the workflow to its pre-fix state using one of these methods:

### Method 1: Using N8N MCP Tools (RECOMMENDED)

```javascript
// Use n8n_update_partial_workflow to restore the AI Resume Customization node
n8n_update_partial_workflow({
  id: "zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG",
  operations: [{
    type: "updateNode",
    nodeId: "05670670-fdb3-421e-9b9e-af04797024c9",
    updates: {
      parameters: {
        // Restore original prompt with $json.data reference
        messages: {
          values: [{
            content: "... Base Resume: {{ $json.data }} ..."
          }]
        }
      }
    }
  }]
});
```

### Method 2: Using N8N Workflow Version History

```javascript
// Rollback to version 2d1dbdc7-ab29-41f4-83d6-de40c1cdecc8
n8n_workflow_versions({
  mode: "rollback",
  workflowId: "zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG",
  versionId: "2d1dbdc7-ab29-41f4-83d6-de40c1cdecc8",
  validateBefore: true
});
```

### Method 3: Manual Import via N8N UI

1. Open N8N UI
2. Navigate to Workflows
3. Click "Import from File"
4. Select `2025-10-26_Resume-Generation-Workshop_zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG_PRE-FIX.json`
5. Confirm import and overwrite existing workflow

---

## Verification Steps After Rollback

1. **Check workflow version ID** - Should be `2d1dbdc7-ab29-41f4-83d6-de40c1cdecc8`
2. **Verify AI Resume Customization node prompt** - Should contain `Base Resume: {{ $json.data }}`
3. **Test workflow execution** - Run a test job application to verify the workflow functions

---

## Node Being Modified

**Node Name**: AI Resume Customization  
**Node ID**: `05670670-fdb3-421e-9b9e-af04797024c9`  
**Node Type**: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.googleGemini`  
**Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash

**Current Prompt (Line 3)**:
```
Base Resume: {{ $json.data }}
```

**Fixed Prompt (Line 3)**:
```
Base Resume: {{ $('Get a document').item.json.content }}
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix (Current Behavior)
- **Input**: User's actual resume (Ivo Dachev, Senior Software Engineer) + Job description
- **Output**: Generic resume with placeholder names like "[Your Name]", "[Previous Company Name]"
- **Problem**: AI receives NO base resume content, generates from scratch

### After Fix (Expected Behavior)
- **Input**: User's actual resume (Ivo Dachev, Senior Software Engineer) + Job description
- **Output**: Customized resume with user's actual name, work history, and skills tailored to the job
- **Result**: AI receives user's actual resume and customizes it properly
