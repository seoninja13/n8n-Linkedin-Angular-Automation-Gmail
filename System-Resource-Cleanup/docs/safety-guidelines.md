# System Resource Cleanup - Safety Guidelines

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-16

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY FIRST PRINCIPLES**

The System Resource Cleanup project follows strict safety protocols to ensure your development environment remains stable and productive. This document outlines essential safety practices and precautions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY RULES**

### **1. Always Use Dry Run First**
```powershell
# ALWAYS test with -DryRun before actual execution
.\scripts\safe-process-cleanup.ps1 -DryRun
.\scripts\comprehensive-cleanup.ps1 -DryRun
.\scripts\apply-vscode-optimizations.ps1 -DryRun
```

**Why**: Dry run mode shows exactly what would be changed without making any modifications.

### **2. Create Backups Before Major Changes**
```powershell
# Backups are enabled by default, but verify:
.\scripts\comprehensive-cleanup.ps1 -CreateBackup
.\scripts\apply-vscode-optimizations.ps1 -CreateBackup
```

**Why**: Backups allow you to restore previous configurations if issues arise.

### **3. Never Run During Active Development**
- ‚ùå **Don't run cleanup while:**
  - Compiling or building projects
  - Running development servers
  - Debugging applications
  - Saving important work

- ‚úÖ **Safe times to run cleanup:**
  - Before starting development work
  - During breaks or lunch
  - End of workday
  - Weekend maintenance

### **4. Monitor System State Before and After**
```powershell
# Check system state before cleanup
.\scripts\system-monitor.ps1

# Run cleanup
.\scripts\safe-process-cleanup.ps1

# Verify results after cleanup
.\scripts\system-monitor.ps1
```

## üîí **PROCESS TERMINATION SAFETY**

### **Protected Processes**
The cleanup scripts **NEVER** terminate processes that have:
- ‚úÖ **Active network connections** (servers, API calls)
- ‚úÖ **Child processes** (parent processes with dependencies)
- ‚úÖ **Large memory footprint** (likely active development servers)
- ‚úÖ **Specific port bindings** (development servers on common ports)

### **Conservative Approach**
- **Node.js processes**: Only terminates smallest processes (likely orphaned)
- **VS Code processes**: Only terminates very small processes (<50MB)
- **Unknown processes**: Always preserved when in doubt

### **Process Identification**
Before termination, scripts check:
```powershell
# Network connections
netstat -ano | findstr PID

# Child processes
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.ParentProcessId -eq $PID }

# Memory usage patterns
Get-Process | Sort-Object WorkingSet
```

## üíæ **DATA PROTECTION MEASURES**

### **No File System Modifications**
Process cleanup scripts **NEVER**:
- ‚ùå Delete source code files
- ‚ùå Modify project configurations
- ‚ùå Remove development dependencies
- ‚ùå Change file permissions

### **Temporary File Safety**
When cleaning temporary files:
- ‚úÖ **Only removes files older than 7 days**
- ‚úÖ **Preserves lock files and active sessions**
- ‚úÖ **Excludes files currently in use**
- ‚úÖ **Skips files larger than 100MB** (likely important)

### **Configuration Backups**
Before applying VS Code optimizations:
```powershell
# Automatic backup creation
$BackupDir = "backups\vscode-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss')"
Copy-Item -Path $SettingsPath -Destination $BackupDir
```

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If Something Goes Wrong**

#### **1. Stop All Cleanup Operations**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop running scripts
# Or close PowerShell window
```

#### **2. Restore from Backup**
```powershell
# Restore VS Code settings
.\scripts\apply-vscode-optimizations.ps1 -RestoreFromBackup -BackupPath "backups\vscode-2025-09-16_14-30-00"
```

#### **3. Restart Development Environment**
```powershell
# Restart VS Code
# Restart development servers
# Verify all projects still work
```

#### **4. Check System Logs**
```powershell
# Review cleanup logs
Get-Content "logs\cleanup-history.log" -Tail 50

# Check Windows Event Log
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Newest 20
```

---

## üîç **PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST**

Before running any cleanup script:

### **System State Check**
- [ ] **Save all open work** in VS Code and other applications
- [ ] **Stop development servers** (npm start, ng serve, etc.)
- [ ] **Close unnecessary applications**
- [ ] **Check available disk space** (ensure >1GB free)
- [ ] **Verify no critical processes running**

### **Script Preparation**
- [ ] **Run with -DryRun first** to preview changes
- [ ] **Review log files** from previous runs
- [ ] **Ensure backup directory has space**
- [ ] **Test restore procedure** if first time using

### **Environment Verification**
- [ ] **PowerShell version 5.1+** (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`)
- [ ] **Administrator rights** (for scheduled tasks only)
- [ ] **No antivirus interference** (whitelist project directory)
- [ ] **Stable system state** (no pending reboots)

---

## üìã **RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX**

### **Low Risk Operations** üü¢
- Running system monitor
- Dry run mode for any script
- Listing scheduled tasks
- Viewing configuration files

### **Medium Risk Operations** üü°
- Safe process cleanup (with backups)
- Temporary file cleanup
- VS Code optimization (with backups)

### **Higher Risk Operations** üî¥
- Comprehensive cleanup without dry run
- Scheduled task creation/removal
- Configuration changes without backups

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **RECOVERY PROCEDURES**

### **VS Code Issues After Optimization**

#### **Symptoms**
- VS Code won't start
- Extensions not working
- Performance worse than before

#### **Recovery Steps**
1. **Restore settings from backup**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\apply-vscode-optimizations.ps1 -RestoreFromBackup -BackupPath "path\to\backup"
   ```

2. **Reset to defaults**:
   ```powershell
   # Delete settings file to reset to defaults
   Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json"
   ```

3. **Reinstall VS Code** (last resort):
   - Uninstall VS Code
   - Delete `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Code`
   - Reinstall VS Code
   - Restore extensions

### **System Performance Issues**

#### **Symptoms**
- System slower after cleanup
- Applications not starting
- High CPU usage

#### **Recovery Steps**
1. **Restart system** to clear any temporary issues
2. **Check process counts** with system monitor
3. **Review cleanup logs** for errors
4. **Restore from system restore point** if available

## üìä **MONITORING AND VALIDATION**

### **Post-Cleanup Verification**
After running cleanup scripts:

1. **Check system performance**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\system-monitor.ps1 -ShowDetails
   ```

2. **Verify development environment**:
   - Start VS Code and open a project
   - Run a simple Node.js script
   - Test development server startup

3. **Review cleanup results**:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "logs\cleanup-history.log" -Tail 20
   ```

### **Performance Metrics**
Monitor these key indicators:
- **Process count reduction**: Should be 20-40%
- **Memory freed**: Should be 500MB-2GB
- **System responsiveness**: Should feel noticeably faster
- **Application startup**: Should be same or faster

---

## üîÑ **BEST PRACTICES**

### **Regular Maintenance**
- **Weekly**: Run safe process cleanup
- **Monthly**: Run comprehensive cleanup with fresh backups
- **Quarterly**: Review and update configuration settings

### **Development Workflow Integration**
- **Morning routine**: Check system monitor
- **Project switching**: Run safe cleanup between projects
- **End of day**: Quick cleanup before shutdown

### **Team Environment**
- **Document customizations** made to cleanup configuration
- **Share backup procedures** with team members
- **Establish cleanup schedules** that don't interfere with team work

---

## üìû **EMERGENCY CONTACTS**

### **Self-Help Resources**
1. **Project documentation** in `docs/` directory
2. **Log files** in `logs/` directory
3. **Configuration files** in `config/` directory
4. **Backup files** in `backups/` directory

### **System Recovery**
1. **Windows System Restore**: `rstrui.exe`
2. **VS Code Reset**: Delete user settings directory
3. **PowerShell Help**: `Get-Help about_Execution_Policies`

---

**üõ°Ô∏è REMEMBER**: When in doubt, don't execute. The cleanup tools are designed to be conservative and safe, but your judgment is the final safety check. Always prioritize data protection and system stability over performance optimization.
