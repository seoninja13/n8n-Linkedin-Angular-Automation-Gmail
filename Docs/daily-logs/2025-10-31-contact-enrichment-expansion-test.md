## Test Results Analysis

### Domain Distribution (7 Companies with Contacts)

| Company | Domain | Contacts | % of Total | Company Size | Revenue |
|---------|--------|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Prosum | prosum.com | 20 | 47.6% | 160 | $20M |
| Odoo | odoo.com | 13 | 31.0% | 5,900 | $408M |
| Luxury Presence | luxurypresence.com | 4 | 9.5% | 700 | $23M |
| Exmox | exmox.com | 2 | 4.8% | 71 | - |
| Jobgether | jobgether.com | 2 | 4.8% | 46 | $1.5M |
| Applause | applause.com | 1 | 2.4% | 1,500 | $150M |
| Attis Global | attisglobal.com | 1 | 2.4% | 5 | - |
| **TOTAL** | - | **42** | **100%** | - | - |

**Key Insight**: Prosum (staffing/recruiting company) returned the most contacts (20) because recruiting is their core business.

### Job Title Breakdown

| Job Title | Count | % of Total |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Technical Recruiter | 11 | 26.2% |
| Senior Technical Recruiter | 7 | 16.7% |
| Recruiter | 6 | 14.3% |
| Talent Acquisition Manager | 4 | 9.5% |
| HR Manager | 3 | 7.1% |
| Recruiting Manager | 3 | 7.1% |
| Senior Recruiting Manager | 2 | 4.8% |
| Sr. Tech Recruiter | 2 | 4.8% |
| Other (4 titles) | 4 | 9.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **100%** |

**Note**: The Actor returned variations of requested job titles (e.g., "Technical Recruiter" instead of just "Recruiter"), which is beneficial as it finds relevant roles even with slight title differences.

### Seniority Level Breakdown

| Seniority Level | Count | % of Total |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| senior | 17 | 40.5% |
| entry | 13 | 31.0% |
| manager | 11 | 26.2% |
| director | 1 | 2.4% |
| c_suite | 0 | 0% |
| vp | 0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **100%** |

**Key Insight**: No C-suite or VP-level contacts found. This is expected because most companies don't have VP of HR or C-suite HR roles, and the Actor prioritizes returning contacts at lower levels where there are more people.

### Functional Level Verification

| Functional Level | Count | % of Total |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| human_resources | 42 | 100% |
| marketing | 0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **100%** |

**Note**: Even though we requested both "marketing" and "human_resources", the Actor only returned HR contacts. This is correct behavior - recruiters are typically in HR, not Marketing.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Expanding (Recommended)
**Goal**: Reach 100-150 contacts per run

**Changes**:
1. Increase `PHASE_1_DOMAIN_LIMIT` from 30 to 50
2. Add more job titles: "HR Director", "Chief People Officer", "Head of Talent", "Talent Partner"
3. Expand `functional_level` to include: "operations", "sales" (for Business Development Recruiters)

**Expected Result**: 80-120 contacts

### Option 2: Keep Current Configuration (Testing)
**Goal**: Validate the workflow end-to-end with 42 contacts

**Rationale**:
- 42 contacts is a good sample size for testing
- Low cost ($0.063 per run)
- Allows verification of the entire pipeline (Contact Enrichment → Job Matching → Resume Generation → Outreach)

**Next Step**: Run the full orchestrator workflow and verify all downstream workshops work correctly

### Option 3: Target Larger Companies Only
**Goal**: Increase hit rate (currently 23% - 7 out of 30 companies)

**Changes**:
1. Filter job discovery to only include companies with 500+ employees
2. Keep current filtering criteria
3. Expect 50-70% hit rate (15-20 companies out of 30)

**Expected Result**: 60-100 contacts from larger companies
