## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: DRAFT MODE = PRODUCTION MODE

**Critical Requirement**: The ONLY difference between draft mode testing and live production should be switching the email node operation from "create draft" to "send". Everything else must be identical and fully implemented during draft testing.

### What This Means:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (Draft Mode)**: Implement the COMPLETE production system (weighted round-robin, Limit node, Google Sheets logging, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (Live Mode)**: Switch draft‚Üísend (5 minutes), then ramp up volume (20-25 days)
- ‚ùå **NO incremental implementation**: All features must be implemented and tested in Phase 1
- ‚ùå **NO structural changes**: Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 requires ONLY changing email operation

### Pinned Data Strategy:
- ‚úÖ Use pinned data for ALL draft mode testing (minimize API calls)
- ‚úÖ Once orchestrator produces valid output, pin that data for downstream testing
- ‚úÖ Only use live data when absolutely necessary (e.g., validating Job Discovery changes)
- ‚ùå Do NOT repeatedly test with live data during draft mode - this wastes API calls

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Job SEO Discovery Workshop**: Tested, has pinned data
- ‚úÖ **Job Discovery Workshop**: Tested, has pinned data
- ‚úÖ **Job Matching Scoring Workshop**: Tested, has pinned data
- ‚è≥ **Contact Enrichment Workshop**: Needs full orchestrator testing
- ‚è≥ **Resume Generation Workshop**: Needs full orchestrator testing
- ‚è≥ **Contact Tracking Workshop**: Needs full orchestrator testing
- ‚è≥ **Outreach Tracking Workshop**: Needs complete production setup in draft mode

### Critical Requirement
**We have modified upstream workflows** (Job Discovery, Job Matching). Before scaling to production, we MUST validate that the entire pipeline works end-to-end with the modified data flowing through all 6 workshops.

### Deployment Strategy
**Simplified 2-Phase Approach** (Total: 20-25 days)

**Phase 1**: Complete system testing in draft mode with pinned data (2-3 hours)  
**Phase 2**: Switch to live email sending + production ramp-up (20-25 days)

### Key Principles
1. **Draft Mode = Production Mode**: Phase 1 implements EVERYTHING except actual sending
2. **Pinned Data Strategy**: Use pinned data for all draft testing to minimize API calls
3. **Simplified Transition**: Phase 1‚ÜíPhase 2 requires ONLY changing draft‚Üísend (5 minutes)
4. **No Incremental Implementation**: All features implemented and tested in Phase 1
5. **Account Capabilities Differ**: Gmail (established, 80%) vs Outlook (new, 20%)
6. **Weighted Round-Robin**: 80% Gmail / 20% Outlook (NOT 50/50 split)

### Account Capabilities (CRITICAL DIFFERENCE)
- **Gmail Account**: Established account with strong sender reputation ‚Üí Can handle 10-20 emails/day immediately
- **Outlook Account**: BRAND NEW account with ZERO sender reputation ‚Üí Must start at 2-5 emails/day, gradually increase

## üéØ PHASE 1: COMPLETE SYSTEM TESTING IN DRAFT MODE

### Duration
**2-3 hours** (implementation + testing)

### Objective
Implement and test the **COMPLETE production system** in draft mode using pinned data. The system should be 100% production-ready, with the ONLY difference being draft vs send operation.

### What to Implement (EVERYTHING)

#### 1. Weighted Round-Robin Logic (80% Gmail / 20% Outlook)
**Node**: "Weighted Round-Robin Account Selector (80/20)" Code node  
**Position**: In Outreach Tracking workflow, after "Resume Filename Customizer" node  
**Code**: See `2025-10-29-weighted-round-robin-implementation-guide.md` - Code Snippet 1

**What it does**:
- Assigns 80% of items to Gmail, 20% to Outlook
- Pattern: G G G G O G G G G O (repeats every 10 items)
- Adds `emailAccount` field to each item

#### 2. Switch Node Routing
**Node**: "Route to Gmail or Outlook" Switch node  
**Position**: After "Weighted Round-Robin Account Selector" node  
**Configuration**: See `2025-10-29-weighted-round-robin-implementation-guide.md` - Code Snippet 2

**What it does**:
- Route 0: Items with `emailAccount='gmail'` ‚Üí Gmail draft node
- Route 1: Items with `emailAccount='outlook'` ‚Üí Outlook draft node

#### 3. Limit Node (Fully Functional)
**Node**: "Daily Email Limit" Limit node  
**Position**: BEFORE "Weighted Round-Robin Account Selector" node  
**Configuration**: 
- Max Items: 10 (for initial testing)
- Keep: First

**What it does**:
- Limits total items processed to specified value
- Fully functional and ready for production
- Will be adjusted during Phase 2 ramp-up (10‚Üí15‚Üí20...‚Üí75)

#### 4. Google Sheets Email Tracking Dashboard Integration
**Nodes**: 
1. "Aggregate Email Metrics" Code node (after Merge node)
2. "Log to Email Tracking Dashboard" Google Sheets node (after Aggregate node)

**Code**: See `2025-10-29-google-sheets-email-tracking-dashboard-design.md`

**What it does**:
- Calculates daily totals (Gmail count, Outlook count, bounce rates, etc.)
- Logs metrics to Google Sheets dashboard
- Tracks account health status
- Provides historical data for monitoring

#### 5. Email Draft Nodes (Draft Mode)
**Gmail Node**: 
- Resource: "message"
- Operation: "create draft" ‚Üê **DRAFT MODE**

**Outlook Node**: 
- Resource: "message"
- Operation: "create draft" ‚Üê **DRAFT MODE**

**Note**: These will be changed to "send" in Phase 2 (5-minute change)

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 0: Prepare Pinned Data (15 minutes)
1. Verify Job Discovery, Job Matching, Contact Enrichment workshops have pinned data
2. If not, execute orchestrator ONCE with live data to generate output
3. Pin the output data from successful execution
4. Use this pinned data for all subsequent Phase 1 testing

#### Step 1: Implement Weighted Round-Robin (15 minutes)
1. Open Outreach Tracking workflow: https://n8n.srv972609.hstgr.cloud/workflow/Vp9DpKF3xT2ysHhx
2. Add "Weighted Round-Robin Account Selector (80/20)" Code node
3. Paste code from implementation guide (Code Snippet 1)
4. Add "Route to Gmail or Outlook" Switch node
5. Configure Switch node (Code Snippet 2)
6. Connect Switch Route 0 to Gmail draft node
7. Connect Switch Route 1 to Outlook draft node
8. Add Merge node after both draft nodes
9. Save workflow

#### Step 2: Add Limit Node (5 minutes)
1. Add "Daily Email Limit" Limit node BEFORE weighted round-robin node
2. Set Max Items: 10
3. Set Keep: First
4. Connect: Previous node ‚Üí Limit node ‚Üí Weighted Round-Robin node
5. Save workflow

#### Step 3: Implement Google Sheets Dashboard Integration (30 minutes)
1. Create Google Sheets spreadsheet: "LinkedIn Email Tracking Dashboard"
2. Add 3 sheets: "Daily Email Metrics", "Per-Email Details", "Weekly Summary"
3. Add column headers according to dashboard design document
4. Add formulas for calculated columns (percentages, bounce rates)
5. Apply conditional formatting rules
6. Share spreadsheet with N8N service account (or configure OAuth2)
7. In Outreach Tracking workflow, add "Aggregate Email Metrics" Code node after Merge node
8. Paste code from dashboard design document
9. Add "Log to Email Tracking Dashboard" Google Sheets node after Aggregate node
10. Configure Google Sheets node with spreadsheet ID and field mappings
11. Save workflow

#### Step 4: Test with Pinned Data - Limit=10 (15 minutes)
1. Execute orchestrator workflow with pinned data
2. Monitor execution progress
3. Verify 10 drafts created (8 Gmail + 2 Outlook)
4. Check Google Sheets dashboard for logged metrics
5. Review draft content and quality
6. Verify weighted distribution is accurate (80/20)

#### Step 5: Test with Different Limit Values (30 minutes)
1. Change Limit node to 15, execute, verify 12 Gmail + 3 Outlook drafts
2. Change Limit node to 20, execute, verify 16 Gmail + 4 Outlook drafts
3. Change Limit node back to 10 for Phase 2 start
4. Verify Google Sheets dashboard logs all test executions correctly

### Validation Checkpoints

## üöÄ PHASE 2: SWITCH TO LIVE EMAIL SENDING + PRODUCTION RAMP-UP

### Duration
**20-25 days** (Day 1: 5 minutes to switch, Days 2-25: ramp-up)

### Objective
Switch from draft mode to live email sending, then gradually ramp up volume from 10 emails/day to 75 emails/day over 20-25 days.

### Day 1: Switch from Draft to Send (5 MINUTES)

**What Changes**:
1. Open Outreach Tracking workflow: https://n8n.srv972609.hstgr.cloud/workflow/Vp9DpKF3xT2ysHhx
2. Find Gmail draft node
3. Change operation: "create draft" ‚Üí "send"
4. Find Outlook draft node
5. Change operation: "create draft" ‚Üí "send"
6. Save workflow
7. Execute orchestrator with Limit=10
8. Verify 10 emails sent (8 Gmail + 2 Outlook)

**What Stays the Same**:
- ‚úÖ Weighted round-robin logic (80/20 split)
- ‚úÖ Limit node configuration (set to 10)
- ‚úÖ Switch node routing
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets logging
- ‚úÖ All other nodes and connections

**NO structural changes. NO new nodes. NO new logic.**

### Days 2-25: Production Ramp-Up

**Strategy**: Adjust Limit node value every 2 days according to ramp-up schedule

**Ramp-Up Schedule**:

| Day | Total/Day | Gmail/Day | Outlook/Day | Limit Node Value | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| 1-2 | 10 | 8 | 2 | 10 | Baseline from Phase 1 |
| 3-4 | 15 | 12 | 3 | 15 | +50% increase |
| 5-6 | 20 | 16 | 4 | 20 | +33% increase |
| 7-8 | 25 | 20 | 5 | 25 | +25% increase |
| 9-10 | 30 | 24 | 6 | 30 | +20% increase |
| 11-12 | 35 | 28 | 7 | 35 | Consider 75/25 split |
| 13-14 | 40 | 32 | 8 | 40 | +14% increase |
| 15-16 | 45 | 36 | 9 | 45 | Consider 70/30 split |
| 17-18 | 50 | 40 | 10 | 50 | +11% increase |
| 19-20 | 55 | 44 | 11 | 55 | +10% increase |
| 21-22 | 60 | 48 | 12 | 60 | Consider 65/35 split |
| 23-24 | 65 | 52 | 13 | 65 | +8% increase |
| **25+** | **75** | **60** | **15** | **75** | **TARGET REACHED** ‚úÖ |

**Note**: Weighted round-robin automatically maintains the configured split. You only need to adjust the Limit node value every 2 days.

### Limit Node Management Options

**Option A: Manual Updates (RECOMMENDED for start)**
- Every 2 days, manually open workflow and update Limit node value
- **Pros**: Simple, full control, easy to pause
- **Cons**: Requires manual intervention
- **Best for**: First 2-3 weeks

**Option B: Workflow Variables**
- Use N8N workflow settings/variables
- **Pros**: Easier than finding node
- **Cons**: Still manual, version compatibility
- **Best for**: Mid-term (after 2-3 weeks)

**Option C: Dynamic Limit Calculation (FULLY AUTOMATED)**
- Code node calculates limit based on current date
- **Pros**: Fully automated
- **Cons**: Less flexible
- **Best for**: Long-term (after 3-4 weeks)
- **Code**: See `2025-10-29-weighted-round-robin-implementation-guide.md` - Code Snippet 3

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, transition to Option C after 3-4 weeks once system is stable.
