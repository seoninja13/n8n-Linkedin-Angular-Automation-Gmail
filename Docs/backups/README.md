# N8N Workflow Backup System
**AI-Assisted Manual Backup Solution Using MCP Tools**

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27

---

## üìã Overview

This is a **manual, on-demand backup solution** for all N8N workflows in the LinkedIn automation project. Backups are performed by the AI agent using N8N MCP server tools exclusively (no REST API calls or PowerShell scripts).

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Uses N8N MCP server tools exclusively (follows MCP-only constraint)
- ‚úÖ Retrieves all 83 workflows in full detail
- ‚úÖ Saves to timestamped backup directories
- ‚úÖ Generates backup index, summary, and log files
- ‚úÖ Supports full, incremental, active-only, and selective backups
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully (continues on individual workflow failures)
- ‚úÖ Displays progress indicators during execution

## üöÄ How to Request a Backup

Simply ask the AI agent to run a backup using one of the templates below. The AI agent will:
1. Retrieve all workflows using N8N MCP tools
2. Save each workflow to individual JSON files
3. Generate backup index, summary, and log files
4. Report completion status and any errors

---

## üìù Backup Request Templates

### **Full Backup** (All 83 Workflows)
```
Run a full N8N workflow backup
```

**What It Does**:
- Retrieves all 83 workflows (active and inactive)
- Saves to `Docs/backups/workflows/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Generates complete backup index and summary
- Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

---

### **Incremental Backup** (Only Modified Workflows)
```
Run an incremental N8N workflow backup (only modified since 2025-10-27)
```

**What It Does**:
- Retrieves only workflows modified after the specified date
- Compares `updatedAt` timestamp with cutoff date
- Saves to `Docs/backups/workflows/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Estimated time: 2-5 minutes (depending on number of modified workflows)

**Note**: Replace `2025-10-27` with the date of your last backup.

---

### **Active Workflows Only**
```
Backup only active N8N workflows
```

**What It Does**:
- Retrieves only workflows with `active: true` status
- Excludes inactive/archived workflows
- Saves to `Docs/backups/workflows/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

---

### **Selective Backup by Category**
```
Backup only Workshop workflows
```

**Available Categories**:
- **Orchestrators**: Main orchestrator workflows
- **Workshops**: All workshop sub-workflows (Job Discovery, Contact Enrichment, Resume Generation, etc.)
- **Mailrooms**: Mailroom service workflows
- **MCP Servers**: MCP server integration workflows
- **Critical**: Only the 9 most critical workflows (orchestrators + workshops)

**What It Does**:
- Retrieves only workflows matching the specified category
- Filters by workflow name patterns or tags
- Saves to `Docs/backups/workflows/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Estimated time: 2-5 minutes

---

### **Specific Workflow Backup**
```
Backup the Resume Generation Workshop workflow (ID: zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG)
```

**What It Does**:
- Retrieves a single workflow by ID
- Saves to `Docs/backups/workflows/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Estimated time: < 1 minute

## üìÑ Output Files

### **1. Individual Workflow JSON Files**
**Naming Convention**: `[workflow-name]--[workflow-id].json`

**Example**: `LinkedIn-SEO-Gmail-Orchestrator--Augment--fGpR7xvrOO7PBa0c.json`

**Contents**:
- Complete workflow configuration
- All nodes with parameters
- All connections
- Workflow settings
- Credential references (IDs only, not actual credentials)
- Tags and metadata
- Version information

**Usage**: These files can be imported back into N8N using the N8N UI (Workflows ‚Üí Import from File)

---

### **2. Backup Index** (`backup-index.md`)
**Purpose**: Complete catalog of all backed up workflows

**Contents**:
- Workflow ID, name, status (active/inactive)
- Last updated timestamp
- Node count
- Tags
- Organized by category (Orchestrators, Workshops, Mailrooms, etc.)
- Summary statistics

**Usage**: Quick reference to find specific workflows in the backup

---

### **3. Backup Summary** (`backup-summary.md`)
**Purpose**: High-level statistics and metrics

**Contents**:
- Total workflows backed up
- Backup duration
- Success/failure counts
- Workflows by category
- Workflows by status (active/inactive)
- Any errors encountered
- Recommendations for next backup

**Usage**: Quick overview of backup operation results

---

### **4. Backup Log** (`backup-log.txt`)
**Purpose**: Detailed execution log

**Contents**:
- Timestamp for each operation
- Workflow retrieval progress
- File save confirmations
- Error messages (if any)
- Performance metrics

**Usage**: Troubleshooting and audit trail

## üîÑ How to Restore Workflows from Backup

### **Option 1: N8N UI Import** (Recommended)
1. Open N8N UI: https://n8n.srv972609.hstgr.cloud
2. Navigate to **Workflows** page
3. Click **Import from File** button
4. Select the workflow JSON file from backup directory
5. Review imported workflow
6. Click **Save** to restore

### **Option 2: Bulk Restore via AI Agent**
```
Restore all workflows from backup directory Docs/backups/workflows/2025-10-27/
```

**What It Does**:
- Reads all JSON files from specified backup directory
- Uses N8N MCP tools to create/update workflows
- Handles credential ID mapping
- Reports success/failure for each workflow

**Note**: Use with caution - this will overwrite existing workflows with the same IDs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Credentials Are Not Backed Up**
- Workflow JSON files contain **credential IDs** (e.g., `"id": "iSUthz6TcizkpxHs"`)
- Workflow JSON files do **NOT** contain actual credential values (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- When restoring workflows, you must ensure the credential IDs still exist in your N8N instance
- If credential IDs have changed, you'll need to manually reconnect credentials after restore

### **Backup Frequency Recommendations**
- **Daily**: If actively developing workflows (high change rate)
- **Weekly**: For stable production workflows (low change rate)
- **Before Major Changes**: Always backup before modifying critical workflows
- **After Successful Deployments**: Backup after deploying new features

### **Backup Retention**
- Keep at least **4 weeks** of backups (28 days)
- Archive older backups to external storage if needed
- Delete backups older than 90 days (unless required for compliance)

### **Backup Verification**
After each backup, verify:
1. ‚úÖ All expected workflows are present in backup directory
2. ‚úÖ JSON files are valid (can be opened in text editor)
3. ‚úÖ Backup index and summary are generated
4. ‚úÖ No critical errors in backup log

## üìä Backup Statistics (Current State)

**Last Full Backup**: 2025-10-27
**Total Workflows**: 83
**Workflows Backed Up**: 9 (10.8%)
**Remaining Workflows**: 74 (89.2%)

**Critical Workflows Backed Up**:
1. ‚úÖ LinkedIn-SEO-Gmail-Orchestrator--Augment (fGpR7xvrOO7PBa0c)
2. ‚úÖ LinkedIn-SEO-Gmail-sub-flow-Workshop-ResumeGeneration--Augment (zTtSVmTg3UaV9tPG)

**Remaining Critical Workflows**:
1. ‚è≥ Contact Enrichment Workshop (rClUELDAK9f4mgJx)
2. ‚è≥ Contact Tracking Workshop (wZyxRjWShhnSFbSV)
3. ‚è≥ Outreach Tracking Workshop (Vp9DpKF3xT2ysHhx)
4. ‚è≥ Job Discovery Workshop (wbkQo6X2R8XQOYgG)
5. ‚è≥ Job Matching Workshop (bpfuL3HjZuD27Ca3)
6. ‚è≥ Validation Reporting Workshop (Xkk3TA9tXqcJfwsc)

**Recommendation**: Run a full backup to capture all 83 workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Backup Takes Too Long**
**Solution**: Use incremental or selective backups instead of full backups

### **Issue: Individual Workflow Retrieval Fails**
**Solution**: The backup process continues with remaining workflows. Check backup log for error details.

### **Issue: JSON File Cannot Be Imported**
**Solution**: Verify JSON file is valid using a JSON validator. If corrupted, re-run backup for that specific workflow.

### **Issue: Credential IDs Don't Match After Restore**
**Solution**: Manually reconnect credentials in N8N UI after restoring workflow.
