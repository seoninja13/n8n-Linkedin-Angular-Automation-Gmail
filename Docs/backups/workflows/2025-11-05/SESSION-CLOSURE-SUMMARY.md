## **NEXT CONVERSATION THREAD OPENING MESSAGE**

```
I have created the 2 required Google Sheets for the Daily Execution Cap feature. Here are the URLs:

**Logs-Execution-Cap**: [paste URL here]
**Logs-Execution-Blocked**: [paste URL here]

Both sheets have the correct column headers and initial data as specified. Please proceed with implementing the 6 Daily Execution Cap nodes in the Main Orchestrator workflow (ID: fGpR7xvrOO7PBa0c) using N8N MCP tools.

**Context**: We completed the N8N workflow backup (8/8 workflows backed up successfully to `Docs/backups/workflows/2025-11-05/`) and are now ready to implement the Daily Execution Cap feature as the next production safety feature.

**Documentation References**:
- Knowledge Transfer: `Docs/handover/conversation-handover-knowledge-transfer.md`
- Daily Log: `Docs/daily-logs/2025-11-05-daily-execution-cap-preparation.md`
- Backup Verification: `Docs/backups/workflows/2025-11-05/BACKUP-VERIFICATION-COMPLETE.md`

Please use Sequential Thinking MCP (MANDATORY) to guide the implementation process.
