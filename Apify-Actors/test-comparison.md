## Conclusion

After comprehensive testing, **Lead Finder | With Emails | $1.4 / 1k (Actor #5)** is the clear winner:
- **Lowest cost** ($1.4/1k)
- **Zero open issues** (most reliable)
- **Perfect input format** (company domain-based)
- **Active development** (36 builds)

The Leads Scraper (Actor #6) should only be used as a backup due to its 66% failure rate and low 12.5% email yield.

All other actors are either unsuitable (URL-based), under maintenance (62 issues), or failed testing (0 results after 1+ hours).

**Action Required**: Run test with Actor #5 using our 8 company domains to confirm email yield > 12.5% before full integration.
