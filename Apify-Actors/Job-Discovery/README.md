## **üìã CATEGORY DESCRIPTION**

This directory contains comprehensive evaluations and documentation for Apify actors that discover and extract job postings from various sources. Unlike contact enrichment actors (which find people), job discovery actors find job opportunities.

**Strategic Goal**: Diversify job sources beyond LinkedIn to include company career pages and alternative job platforms where competition is lower and candidates have higher visibility.

---

## **üéØ USE CASES**

### **Primary Use Case: Job Discovery Pipeline**
- **Current Limitation**: LinkedIn-only job discovery creates high competition (many applicants per job posting)
- **Solution**: Use multiple job discovery sources to find opportunities with lower competition
- **Integration Point**: Job Discovery Workshop (N8N workflow) processes job data from multiple sources

### **Secondary Use Cases**
- Job board backfill with high-quality real jobs
- Lead generation for recruitment agencies
- Market research on hiring trends
- Competitive intelligence on company hiring
