## **üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **RECOMMENDATION: ‚úÖ SUPPLEMENT**

**Use Career Site Job Listing Feed actor ALONGSIDE LinkedIn job discovery to diversify job sources and reduce competition.**

### **Top 3 Reasons to Adopt**

1. **Lower Competition**: Direct company career page postings have fewer applicants than LinkedIn jobs
2. **Cost-Effective**: $1.20 per 1,000 jobs ($0.0012 per job) with pay-per-result pricing
3. **High Data Quality**: 100% success rate, 60+ fields per job, AI-enriched data, LinkedIn company integration

### **Top 3 Concerns**

1. **Database-Backed**: Not a real-time scraper; jobs are scraped in backend with small delay (updated twice per hour)
2. **Limited to 5,000 Jobs**: Maximum 5,000 jobs per run (contact developer for higher limits)
3. **Feed-Based Model**: Returns ALL active jobs matching criteria (not incremental like API version)

### **Strategic Impact**

- **Diversifies Job Sources**: Expands beyond LinkedIn to 125k+ company career sites
- **Reduces Competition**: Company career pages have lower applicant-to-job ratios
- **Increases Visibility**: Direct applications show higher engagement than LinkedIn applications
- **Improves Data Quality**: 60+ fields per job vs. basic LinkedIn data

## **üéØ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION**

### **RECOMMENDATION: ‚úÖ SUPPLEMENT**

**Use Career Site Job Listing Feed actor ALONGSIDE LinkedIn job discovery to diversify job sources and reduce competition.**

### **Rationale**

1. **Diversification**: Expands job sources beyond LinkedIn to 125k+ company career sites
2. **Lower Competition**: Direct company postings have fewer applicants than LinkedIn
3. **Cost-Effective**: $0.0012 per job with transparent pay-per-result pricing
4. **High Data Quality**: 100% success rate, 60+ fields per job, AI-enriched
5. **Simple Integration**: 2-4 hours to integrate into existing N8N workflow
6. **Complementary**: Does not replace LinkedIn; supplements it with additional sources

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Testing (Week 1)**
1. Create Apify account and generate API token
2. Add Apify credentials to N8N
3. Create test workflow with Career Site Feed actor
4. Run test with 200 jobs matching your criteria
5. Validate output data quality and field mapping
6. Calculate actual cost per job for your use case

#### **Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)**
1. Add Career Site Feed node to Job Discovery Workshop
2. Configure input parameters (title, location, filters)
3. Map output fields to workshop schema
4. Implement deduplication logic (title + organization + location)
5. Test with 500 jobs
6. Monitor execution time and cost

#### **Phase 3: Parallel Operation (Week 3-4)**
1. Run LinkedIn and Career Site actors in parallel
2. Merge results from both sources
3. Deduplicate across sources
4. Compare job quality and application success rates
5. Adjust filters based on results
6. Scale to production volume (1,000-5,000 jobs)

#### **Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)**
1. Monitor cost per job vs. LinkedIn
2. Track application success rates by source
3. Refine filters to improve job quality
4. Adjust batch sizes for optimal performance
5. Consider switching to API version for incremental updates (if needed)

### **Expected Impact**

- **Increased Job Coverage**: 2-3x more job opportunities
- **Reduced Competition**: 30-50% fewer applicants per job (estimated)
- **Improved Visibility**: Higher response rates from direct applications
- **Cost Savings**: Predictable $0.0012 per job vs. variable LinkedIn costs
- **Better Data**: 60+ fields per job vs. basic LinkedIn data

### **Success Criteria**

- ‚úÖ Track application success rates by source
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate 20%+ increase in interview requests from Career Site jobs

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS**

### **1. Feed-Based vs. API-Based**

**Current Actor (Feed)**: Returns ALL active jobs matching criteria
**Alternative (API)**: Returns only NEW jobs posted in time frame (hourly, daily, weekly)

**Recommendation**: Start with Feed actor for initial backfill, then consider switching to API actor for incremental updates if you need >5,000 jobs/month.

### **2. Deduplication Strategy**

Organizations may create duplicate listings for multiple cities/states. Implement deduplication on:
- `title` + `organization`
- `title` + `organization` + `locations_derived`

### **3. Description Search Performance**

Description search is VERY intensive and may timeout. Always combine with other filters (preferably `titleSearch`).

### **4. Maximum Jobs Limitation**

Cannot retrieve >5,000 jobs per run. If you need more:
- Run multiple times with different filters
- Contact developer for custom solution
- Consider switching to API version
