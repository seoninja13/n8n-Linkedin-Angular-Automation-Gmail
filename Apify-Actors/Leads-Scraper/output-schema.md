| `position` | `jobTitle` | **Field name change** |
| `organization.name` | `company` | **Nested field extraction** |
| `linkedinUrl` | `linkedinUrl` | Direct mapping |
| `organization.website` | `companyDomain` | **Nested field extraction** |
| `email` (presence) | `emailStatus` | **Derived field**: "Verified" if email exists |

### **Output Formatting Logic**

```javascript
// Transform Leads Scraper output to Contact Enrichment format
const transformedContacts = items.map(lead => ({
  firstName: lead.firstName || '',
  lastName: lead.lastName || '', 
  email: lead.email || '',
  jobTitle: lead.position || '',
  company: lead.organization?.name || '',
  linkedinUrl: lead.linkedinUrl || '',
  emailStatus: lead.email ? 'Verified' : 'Not Available',
  companyDomain: lead.organization?.website || '',
  
  // Additional fields for enrichment
  personId: lead.personId,
  fullName: lead.fullName,
  seniority: lead.seniority || [],
  companySize: lead.organization?.size || '',
  companyIndustry: lead.organization?.industry || '',
  companyLinkedin: lead.organization?.linkedinUrl || '',
  personLocation: {
    city: lead.city || '',
    state: lead.state || '', 
    country: lead.country || ''
  },
  companyLocation: {
    city: lead.organization?.location?.city || '',
    state: lead.organization?.location?.state || '',
    country: lead.organization?.location?.country || ''
  }
}));

return transformedContacts.map(contact => ({ json: contact }));
```

## üìä **Data Quality Expectations**

### **Email Availability**
- **Success Rate**: 65-70% of leads include email
- **Quality**: Emails are verified when available
- **Missing Emails**: ~30-35% of leads may not have email data

### **LinkedIn Coverage**
- **Person LinkedIn**: High availability (most leads include)
- **Company LinkedIn**: Good availability through organization object
- **URL Format**: Full LinkedIn profile URLs

### **Company Data Richness**
- **Basic Info**: Name, website, size always available
- **Extended Info**: Industry, description, founding year often available
- **Location**: Company headquarters location included

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **Data Completeness**
- Not all fields guaranteed for every lead
- Email availability varies (65-70% success rate)
- Some organization fields may be null/empty

### **Deduplication Strategy**
- Use `personId` for person-level deduplication
- Use `organization.id` for company-level deduplication  
- Fallback to `email` + `organization.website` combination

### **Error Handling**
- Check for null/undefined values in nested objects
- Provide fallback values for missing data
- Log missing critical fields (email, company name)
